Local RAG Assistant(by Tanishq Verma)
This project is a document-based question-answering system that lets users upload their own files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, or CSV) and ask questions directly from the content.
It follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach — meaning it finds relevant information from your documents and then generates precise answers using an AI model.
